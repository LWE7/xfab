*Organisation*

Don't forget your USB key when leaving the fablab.

*Laser*

Opening an svg file in Corel Draw to send to the laser cutter: make sure there is no opacity/blur. Prefer plain svg to Inkscape svg format.
Burn marks on lasercut wood: masking tape may help also the orange soap could clean them afterwards.
Make sure the dimension in Corel are the one of the laser working surface (Epilog: 60x30 cm) otherwise your cuts will be shifted.
0.1 and thin line thickness define the cut.

*Ultimaker*

Clean after yourself (support, extrusion test spirals) and make sure no plastic part falls under the plate.

*Up*

Those 3D printers are highly delicate, they decalibrate and get clogged really easily.
Before launching your print make sure the plate temperature reached 80°. Center your model as much as possible. Be gentle to the plate.
Sometimes Fast/Turbo prints work better.

*Builder*

The printing heads are costly, this is why no print can be launched without the validation of the FabManager.
Once launched the extruder ration needs to be put to 50 so that both spools are used.

*Stratasys*

The prints are expensive, this is why no print can be launched without the validation of the FabManager.
Printing in glossy consumes less material.
The support is slightly toxic so use nitrile gloves to manipulate them, wash your hands with cold water if you touched them without.
The prints need to be cleaned with high pressure water.

*Polysher*

The polishing is restricted to the pieces which were printed with a PolySmooth filament and those who can be inserted in the machine.

*Flex printing*

The Ultimaker 2 is usually loaded with NinjaFlex filament. Parameters need to be tuned to print successfully.
Select Custm3  and tune the following parameters are: 
- no ventilation
- 40% filling
- 239°C filament temperature
- 60°C plate
- speed 16%
- material flow 140%
- printing speed 30 mm/s
- displacemnt speed 60 mm/s
